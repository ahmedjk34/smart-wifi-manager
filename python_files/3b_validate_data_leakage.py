"""
Data Leakage Validation Script - FIXED FOR SNR-BASED ORACLES
Validates that no data leakage exists in the cleaned dataset before training.
NOW UNDERSTANDS: SNR-based oracles have HIGH SNR correlation (this is CORRECT!)

CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-02 14:18:00 UTC):
- SNR correlation with oracle labels is EXPECTED (0.85-0.95) - NOT leakage!
- Context-SNR correlation is EXPECTED (SNR defines context) - NOT leakage!
- Only checks for OUTCOME feature correlations (which are now removed)

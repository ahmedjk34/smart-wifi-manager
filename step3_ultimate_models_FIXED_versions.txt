User: ahmedjk34
Total Pipeline Runtime: 104.58 seconds (1.74 minutes)

DATASET CONFIGURATION:
- Source File: smart-v3-ml-enriched.csv
- Row Limiting: DISABLED
- Using FULL dataset (no sampling)
- Dataset includes context, oracle labels, synthetic edge cases, and new features
- BULLETPROOF class preservation - all 8 rate classes guaranteed
- Used class weights for imbalanced data: True

CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
- Removed phyRate (1.000 correlation with target - critical leakage)
- Removed optimalRateDistance (perfect class mapping - critical leakage)
- Removed recentThroughputTrend (0.853 correlation - high leakage)
- Removed conservativeFactor (-0.809 correlation - high leakage)
- Removed aggressiveFactor and recommendedSafeRate (potential leakage)
- Result: Realistic 75-95% accuracy instead of suspicious 100%

MODELS TRAINED:
1. RandomForestClassifier (rateIdx) - FIXED VERSION
   Validation Accuracy: 0.9782 (97.8%)
   Test Accuracy: 0.9789 (97.9%)
   Cross-Validation: 0.9785 (97.8%)
   Training Time: 10.19s
   Used Class Weights: True

CONFIGURATION:
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Estimators: 100 trees
- Max Depth: 15
- Scaler: StandardScaler
- Features (28): lastSnr, snrFast, snrSlow, snrTrendShort, snrStabilityIndex, snrPredictionConfidence, shortSuccRatio, medSuccRatio, consecSuccess, consecFailure, packetLossRate, retrySuccessRatio, recentRateChanges, timeSinceLastRateChange, rateStabilityScore, severity, confidence, T1, T2, T3, decisionReason, packetSuccess, offeredLoad, queueLen, retryCount, channelWidth, mobilityMetric, snrVariance
- Split: 60/20/20 stratified (train/val/test)
- Random State: 42
- Imbalance Handling: Class Weights (preserves realistic distributions)

FILES GENERATED:
- step3_scaler_FIXED.joblib (StandardScaler)
- step3_rf_rateIdx_model_FIXED.joblib (Random Forest for rateIdx)
- step3_ultimate_models_FIXED_versions.txt (this file)

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
- EXCELLENT: Model achieves >90% accuracy with realistic features

NEXT STEPS:
- Deploy model in ns-3 WiFi simulation environment
- Compare performance against existing rate adaptation algorithms
- Monitor real-world performance and collect feedback data
- Consider ensemble methods if higher accuracy needed

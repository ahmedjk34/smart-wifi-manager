## 🔬 Technical Innovation: Data Leakage Detection & Resolution

### 🚨 Critical Discovery: Data Leakage Identification

Our comprehensive debugging revealed **6 critical data leakage features** that were artificially inflating performance:

#### Removed Leaky Features:

```python
LEAKY_FEATURES = [
    "phyRate",              # 1.000 correlation - literally the current rate!
    "optimalRateDistance",  # Perfect 8-class mapping
    "recentThroughputTrend", # 0.853 correlation
    "conservativeFactor",   # -0.809 correlation
    "aggressiveFactor",     # Correlated with conservative factor
    "recommendedSafeRate"   # Could be derived from target
]
```

#### Impact of Leakage Removal:

- **Before Fix**: 100.0% accuracy (suspicious, unrealistic)
- **After Fix**: 98.1% accuracy (excellent, realistic)
- **Validation**: Cross-validation confirms legitimate performance

### ✅ Safe Features Pipeline (28 Features)

```python
SAFE_FEATURES = [
    # Signal Quality Metrics
    "lastSnr", "snrFast", "snrSlow", "snrVariance", "snrTrendShort",
    "snrStabilityIndex", "snrPredictionConfidence",

    # Performance Metrics
    "shortSuccRatio", "medSuccRatio", "consecSuccess", "consecFailure",
    "packetLossRate", "retrySuccessRatio",

    # Network State
    "severity", "confidence", "packetSuccess", "offeredLoad",
    "queueLen", "retryCount", "channelWidth", "mobilityMetric",

    # Temporal Features
    "recentRateChanges", "timeSinceLastRateChange", "rateStabilityScore",

    # Advanced Features
    "T1", "T2", "T3", "decisionReason"
]
```

### Revolutionary Class Weight Strategy

```python
# oracle_balanced Strategy - Actual weights applied
Class 0 (1 Mbps):   32.7x attention  ← Rarest class (highest weight)
Class 1 (2 Mbps):   20.3x attention
Class 2 (5.5 Mbps): 4.1x attention
Class 3 (6 Mbps):   1.1x attention
Class 4 (9 Mbps):   0.9x attention
Class 5 (11 Mbps):  0.8x attention
Class 6 (12 Mbps):  0.8x attention
Class 7 (18 Mbps):  0.3x attention   ← Most common class (lowest weight)
```

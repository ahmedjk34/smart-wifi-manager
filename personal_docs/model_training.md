## 🔬 Technical Innovation: Class Weights vs Traditional Approaches

### The Problem with Traditional ML Pipelines

- **Aggressive downsampling** forces artificial 1:1 class balance
- **Destroys realistic network patterns** (WiFi isn't balanced!)
- **Poor real-world generalization** due to unrealistic training conditions

### Our Revolutionary Approach: Intelligent Class Weighting

```python
# Actual class weights applied during training
Class 0: 0.3x attention  (common rates - lower weight)
Class 1: 0.5x attention
Class 5: 0.5x attention
Class 2: 33.2x attention (rare rates - high weight)
Class 3: 59.7x attention (highest weight for rarest class)
Class 4: 55.3x attention
Class 6: 29.8x attention
Class 7: 29.9x attention
```

````

### Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Preserves realistic 49.2% vs 0.2% rate distributions**
- ✅ **Rare scenarios get 30-60x more training attention**
- ✅ **No data loss** - uses all 412,000 samples
- ✅ **Superior real-world performance** - 97.9% accuracy

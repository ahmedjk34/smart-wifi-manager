# Smart WiFi Rate Adaptation ML Pipeline

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for intelligent WiFi rate adaptation using ns-3 simulation data. This project implements class weight-based training instead of aggressive downsampling to preserve realistic network conditions while handling class imbalance effectively.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models for WiFi rate adaptation that can intelligently select optimal transmission rates based on real-time network conditions. Unlike traditional approaches that force artificial class balance, our pipeline preserves realistic network distributions while using class weights to ensure minority classes receive appropriate attention during training.

## 📊 Key Achievements

- **412,000 training samples** with 42 engineered features
- **Class weight-based imbalance handling** preserving realistic network distributions
- **3 oracle strategies**: Conservative, Balanced, and Aggressive rate adaptation
- **12 synthetic edge case scenarios** for robust model training
- **6 network context classifications** covering all WiFi conditions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline

```

Raw WiFi Data → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Context Classification → Oracle Labels → Class Weights → ML Training

```

### Network Context Classification

- **Emergency Recovery**: SNR < 10dB, Success < 50%, Consecutive failures ≥ 3
- **Poor Unstable**: SNR < 15dB, High variance conditions
- **Marginal Conditions**: SNR < 20dB, Success < 80%
- **Good Unstable**: High SNR variance but decent performance
- **Good Stable**: Stable conditions with good performance

## 🔬 Technical Innovation: Class Weights vs Downsampling

### The Problem with Traditional Approaches

Most ML pipelines for imbalanced data use aggressive downsampling:

- ❌ Forces artificial 1:1 class balance
- ❌ Destroys realistic network patterns
- ❌ Removes valuable majority class information
- ❌ Poor generalization to real-world scenarios

### Our Solution: Intelligent Class Weighting

```python
# Example class weights for rateIdx
rateIdx Class Weights:
  0: 0.254   # Common rates (low weight)
  1: 0.507
  5: 0.509
  2: 33.204  # Rare rates (high weight)
  3: 59.745
  4: 55.317
  6: 29.838
  7: 29.855
```

### Benefits:

- ✅ Preserves realistic 49.2% vs 0.2% rate distributions
- ✅ Rare scenarios get 30-60x more training attention
- ✅ No data loss - keeps all valuable samples
- ✅ Better real-world generalization

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Class Weights Over Downsampling

**Rationale**: Network data imbalance is informative, not noise. Preserving realistic distributions while adjusting training weights yields better real-world performance.

### 2. Context-Aware Oracle Labels

**Rationale**: Different network conditions require different strategies. Emergency scenarios need conservative approaches, while stable conditions can afford aggressive optimization.

### 3. Synthetic Edge Case Generation

**Rationale**: Real data may lack critical failure scenarios. Synthetic generation ensures model robustness in edge conditions.

### 4. Multi-Strategy Training

**Rationale**: Different applications need different risk profiles. Training multiple oracle strategies provides deployment flexibility.
